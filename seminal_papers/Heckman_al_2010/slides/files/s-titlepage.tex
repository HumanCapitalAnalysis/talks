This paper estimates the rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program, an early intervention
program targeted toward disadvantaged African-American youth. Estimates of the rate of return to the Perry
program are widely cited to support the claim of substantial economic benefits from preschool education
programs. Previous studies of the rate of return to this program ignore the compromises that occurred in the
randomization protocol. They do not report standard errors. The rates of return estimated in this paper
account for these factors. We conduct an extensive analysis of sensitivity to alternative plausible
assumptions. Estimated annual social rates of return generally fall between 7 and 10\%, with most estimates
substantially lower than those previously reported in the literature. However, returns are generally
statistically significantly different from zero for both males and females and are above the historical return
on equity. Estimated benefit-to-cost ratios support this conclusion.
