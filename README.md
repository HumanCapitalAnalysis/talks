# Talks

This public repository contains material for several talks.

## Guest presentations

We were lucky to host some guest presentations.

### [Using Childhood Skills to Forecast Lifecycle Outcomes](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/guest_presentations/01_forecasting_lifecycle_outcomes.pdf) by [cocorbin](https://github.com/cocorbin)

I provide a brief overview on our research respective the forecasting of life-cycle outcomes using childhood skills. The presentation addresses the following questions: How predictive are cognitive and non-cognitive skills measured at early childhood, relative to those measured at later ages? What is the best forecasting model based on childhood skill measures for each of adult outcome? How does the predictive power of skills vary across outcome distribution?

### [Introduction to GitHub and Authorea](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/guest_presentations/02_intro_github_authorea.ipynb#/) by [sebecker](https://github.com/sebecker)

I provide a brief overview on Authorea, the tool that the students are supposed to use for their collaborative writing projects. The slides also include a short introduction to Git/GitHub. For more information about the features and applications of Authorea see: [Authorea Help Center](https://intercom.help/authorea/).

### Introduction to Data Analytics using Python - [Slides](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/guest_presentations/03_intro_data_analytics.pdf) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/guest_presentations/03_intro_data_analytics.ipynb#/) by [tobiasraabe](https://github.com/tobiasraabe)

First, I provide a brief overview on Python and data analytics, supplementary material and state-of-the-art applications in the slides. Second, a short introduction to pandas and its powerful applications is shown in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

### [Introduction to the NLSY Dataset](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/guest_presentations/04_intro_nlsy_dataset.pdf) by [benediktkauf](https://github.com/benediktkauf)

I provide a brief overview on the NLSY dataset.

## Seminal papers

We discuss some of the seminal papers in the literature.

### [Estimating marginal returns to education](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/seminal_papers/01_Carneiro_al_2011.pdf)

This paper estimates marginal returns to college for individuals induced to enroll in college by different marginal policy changes. The recent instrumental variables literature seeks to estimate this parameter, but in general it does so only under strong assumptions that are tested and found wanting. The authors show how to utilize economic theory and local instrumental variables estimators to estimate the effect of marginal policy changes.

### [Estimating the technology of cognitive and noncognitive skill formation](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/seminal_papers/02_Cunha_al_2010.pdf)

This paper formulates and estimates multistage production functions for children's cognitive and noncognitive skills.  Using the estimated technology, the authors determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills.

### [The rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/seminal_papers/03_Heckman_al_2010.pdf)

This paper estimates the rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program, an early intervention program targeted toward disadvantaged African-American youth. The authors try to explicitly address the compromising of the randomization protocol.

### [The career decisions of young men](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/seminal_papers/04_Keane_al_1997.pdf)

This paper provides structural estimates of a dynamic model of schooling, work, and occupational choice decisions based on 11 years of observations on a sample of young men from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLSY). The structural estimation framework that we adopt fully imposes the restrictions of the theory and permits an investigation of whether such a theoretically restricted model can succeed in quantitatively fitting the observed data patterns. We find that a suitably extended human capital investment model can in fact do an excellent job of fitting observed data on school attendance, work, occupational choices, and wages in the NLSY data on young men and also produces reasonable forecasts of future work decisions and wage patterns.

## Research skills

We share some basic research skills that turned out to be useful.

### [Reading scientific papers](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/research_skills/01_reading_scientific_papers.pdf)

We disuss some best practices on how to read scientific papers.

### [Mathematical modeling](https://github.com/HumanCapitalEconomics/talks/blob/master/distribution/research_skills/02_mathematical_modeling.pdf)

We discuss the basic ideas of mathematical modeling with special reference to economic models.
