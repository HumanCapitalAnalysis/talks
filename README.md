# Talks

This repository contains all material for the talks.

### [Overview on the Generalized Roy Model](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/overview_generalized_roy/slides.pdf) by [peisenha](https://github.com/peisenha)

I provide a brief overview on the conceptual framework provided by the generalized Roy model. We discuss alternative sources of heterogeneity, numerous parameters of interest, and explore the marginal treatment effect in detail.

### [Returns to Education](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/returns_to_education/slides.pdf) by [peisenha](https://github.com/peisenha)

I discuss the current literature attempting to estimate returns to education.

### [Using Childhood Skills to Forecast Lifecycle Outcomes](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/forecasting_lifecycle_outcomes/slides.pdf) by [cocorbin](https://github.com/cocorbin)

I provide a brief overview of our research respective the forecasting of lifecycle outcomes using childhood skills. The presentation adresses the following questions: 
* How predicitve are cognitive and non-cognitive skills measured at early childhood, relative to those measured at later ages?
* What is the best forcasting model based on childhood skill measures for each of adult outcome?
* How does the predictive power of skills vary across outcome distribution?


### [Introduction to GitHub and Authorea](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_github_authorea/lecture.ipynb#/) by [sebecker](https://github.com/sebecker)

I provide a brief overview of Authorea, the tool we plan to use for the collaborative writing projects. The slides also include a short introduction to Git/GitHub. For more information about the features and applications of Authorea see: [Authorea Help Center](https://intercom.help/authorea/).

### [Introduction to Data Analytics using Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_data_analytics/lecture.ipynb#/) by [tobiasraabe](https://github.com/tobiasraabe)

I provide a brief overview on data analytics using Python.

### [Introduction to the NLSY Dataset](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_nlsy_dataset/lecture.ipynb#/) by [benediktkauf](https://github.com/benediktkauf)

I provide a brief overview on the NLSY dataset.


## Seminal Papers

We maintain a collection of presentations on seminal papers in the econometrics of policy evaluation.

### [Estimating marginal returns to education](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/seminal_papers/Carneiro_Heckman_Vytlacil_2011/slides.pdf)

This paper estimates marginal returns to college for individuals induced to enroll in college by different marginal policy changes. The recent instrumental variables literature seeks to estimate this parameter, but in general it does so only under strong assumptions that are tested and found wanting. The authors show how to utilize economic theory and local instrumental variables estimators to estimate the effect of marginal policy changes.  

### [The rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/seminal_papers/Heckman_al_2010/slides.pdf)

This paper estimates the rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program, an early intervention program targeted toward disadvantaged African-American youth. The authors try to explicitly address the compromising of the randomization protocol.
