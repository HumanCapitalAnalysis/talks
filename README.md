### [Overview on the Generalized Roy Model](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/overview_generalized_roy/slides.pdf) by [peisenha](https://github.com/peisenha)

I provide a brief overview on the conceptual framework provided by the generalized Roy model. We discuss alternative sources of heterogeneity, numerous parameters of interest, and explore the marginal treatment effect in detail.

### [Returns to Education](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/returns_to_education/slides.pdf) by [peisenha](https://github.com/peisenha)

I discuss the current literature attempting to estimate returns to education.

### [Using Childhood Skills to Forecast Lifecycle Outcomes](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/forecasting_lifecycle_outcomes/slides.pdf) by [cocorbin](https://github.com/cocorbin)

I provide a brief overview on our research respective the forecasting of life-cycle outcomes using childhood skills. The presentation addresses the following questions:
* How predictive are cognitive and non-cognitive skills measured at early childhood, relative to those measured at later ages?
* What is the best for recasting model based on childhood skill measures for each of adult outcome?
* How does the predictive power of skills vary across outcome distribution?

### [Introduction to GitHub and Authorea](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_github_authorea/lecture.ipynb#/) by [sebecker](https://github.com/sebecker)

I provide a brief overview on Authorea, the tool that the students are supposed to use for their collaborative writing projects. The slides also include a short introduction to Git/GitHub. For more information about the features and applications of Authorea see: [Authorea Help Center](https://intercom.help/authorea/).

### Introduction to Data Analytics using Python - [Slides](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_data_analytics/slides.pdf) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_data_analytics/data_analytics.ipynb) by [tobiasraabe](https://github.com/tobiasraabe)

First, I provide a brief overview on Python and data analytics, supplementary material and state-of-the-art applications in the slides. Second, a short introduction to pandas and its powerful applications is shown in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

### [Introduction to the NLSY Dataset](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/intro_nlsy_dataset/NLSY_intro.pdf) by [benediktkauf](https://github.com/benediktkauf)
