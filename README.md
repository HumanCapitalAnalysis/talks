### [Using Childhood Skills to Forecast Lifecycle Outcomes](https://github.com/policyMetrics/talks/blob/master/forecasting_lifecycle_outcomes/slides.pdf) by [cocorbin](https://github.com/cocorbin)

I provide a brief overview of our research respective the forecasting of lifecycle outcomes using childhood skills. The presentation adresses the following questions:
* How predicitve are cognitive and non-cognitive skills measured at early childhood, relative to those measured at later ages?
* What is the best forcasting model based on childhood skill measures for each of adult outcome?
* How does the predictive power of skills vary across outcome distribution?
