# Talks

This public repository contains material for several talks.

## Selected topics

### [Simulation of choice probabilities](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/selected-topics/01-simulation-choice-probabilities/slides.pdf)

We discuss the simulation of choice probabilities in the context of a Probit model. We visit the crude accept - reject simulator and its smoothed extension.

### [Sensitivity analysis](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/selected-topics/02-sensitivity-analysis/slides.pdf)

We discuss the basic ideas behind sensitivity analysis of computational models. We distinguish between qualitative and quantitative sensitivity analysis and contrast the term ``sensitivity analysis`` to its use in the econometrics literature. We use the Ishigami function (Ishigami and Homma (1990)) to illustrate some of the issues we discuss. The supporting codes are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/selected-topics/02-sensitivity-analysis/python/ishigami.py).

### [High performance computing using Python](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/selected-topics/03-high-performance-python/slides.pdf)

We present the basics of using Python for high performance computing.

## Overviews

We provide an overview on selected topics.

### [Introduction to the generalized Roy model](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/overviews/01-intro-generalized-roy/slides.pdf)

We review the basic setup of the generalized Roy model and discuss the different parameters of interest.

### [Life cycle wage growth](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/talks/blob/master/overviews/02-life-cycle-wages/slides.pdf)

We discuss the handbook chapter by Rubinstein and Weiss on post schooling wage growth.

> The survey presents basic facts on wage growth and summarizes the main ideas on the possible sources of this growth. We document that wage growth happens mainly early in the life cycle and is then associated with increasing labor force participation and high job mobility. Wage growth during the first decade in the labor market, is about 50% for high school graduates and about 80% for those with college or more. This growth is comparable in size to the accumulated contribution of schooling for these two groups. We describe in detail models of wage growth that can explain these results, including investment in human capital, search and learning. We also discuss the roles of contracts
in sharing the risks associated with learning about ability and varying market conditions.Evidence supporting investment is the U shaped life cycle profile for the variance of wages. However, heterogeneity matters and individuals with relatively high life time earnings have both a higher mean and a higher growth. Evidence supporting search is the high wage gains obtained from changing employers early in the career. Evidence for learning are the initially rising hazard of quitting and the rising rewards for AFQT scores that are not observed by the market.

### [Tyranny of metrics]()

>How the obsession with quantifying human performance threatens our schools, medical care, businesses, and government. Today, organizations of all kinds are ruled by the belief that the path to success is quantifying human performance, publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to fixating on measuring itself. The result is a tyranny of metrics that threatens the quality of our lives and most important institutions. In this timely and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the damage our obsession with metrics is causing―and shows how we can begin to fix the problem. Filled with examples from education, medicine, business and finance, government, the police and military, and philanthropy and foreign aid, this brief and accessible book explains why the seemingly irresistible pressure to quantify performance distorts and distracts, whether by encouraging "gaming the stats" or "teaching to the test." That's because what can and does get measured is not always worth measuring, may not be what we really want to know, and may draw effort away from the things we care about. Along the way, we learn why paying for measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may increase deaths, and much more. But metrics can be good when used as a complement to―rather than a replacement for―judgment based on personal experience, and Muller also gives examples of when metrics have been beneficial. Complete with a checklist of when and how to use metrics, The Tyranny of Metrics is an essential corrective to a rarely questioned trend that increasingly affects us all.

## Seminal papers

We discuss some of the seminal papers in the literature.

### [Estimating marginal returns to education]()

This paper estimates marginal returns to college for individuals induced to enroll in college by different marginal policy changes. The recent instrumental variables literature seeks to estimate this parameter, but in general it does so only under strong assumptions that are tested and found wanting. The authors show how to utilize economic theory and local instrumental variables estimators to estimate the effect of marginal policy changes.

### [Estimating the technology of cognitive and noncognitive skill formation]()

This paper formulates and estimates multistage production functions for children's cognitive and noncognitive skills.  Using the estimated technology, the authors determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills.

### [The rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program]()

This paper estimates the rate of return to the HighScope Perry Preschool Program, an early intervention program targeted toward disadvantaged African-American youth. The authors try to explicitly address the compromising of the randomization protocol.

### [The career decisions of young men]()

This paper provides structural estimates of a dynamic model of schooling, work, and occupational choice decisions based on 11 years of observations on a sample of young men from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLSY). The structural estimation framework that we adopt fully imposes the restrictions of the theory and permits an investigation of whether such a theoretically restricted model can succeed in quantitatively fitting the observed data patterns. We find that a suitably extended human capital investment model can in fact do an excellent job of fitting observed data on school attendance, work, occupational choices, and wages in the NLSY data on young men and also produces reasonable forecasts of future work decisions and wage patterns.
